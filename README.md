# Academic-Performance-Prediction
Overview
This project is a machine learning-based analysis and prediction tool that identifies key factors affecting student academic performance. It utilizes various classification models to predict student grades based on behavioral and academic indicators such as attendance, study time, and classroom interaction.
The dataset includes students from different nationalities and grade levels, offering a diverse view of educational performance trends.

Objectives
To analyze which features most influence student performance.
To build and evaluate multiple classification models for predicting grades.
To visualize insights using graphs, confusion matrices, and evaluation metrics.
